## Description
this project is a team generator, once the user types npm run start in the terminal they are, meet with a welcome message and a menu they must select a manager, once they have selected the manager you can change the manager at any time, they also can add interns and engineers, once happy with the selection hit save and view, it will load up the HTML in another window, feeling a bit tired? take a break be sure to save before taking a break and have fun ;)
